            <p>L.S.</p>
            <p>This used to be the location for the ‘ITsat Action client’ to view results on the IT satisfaction measurements we do for your organization.</p>
            <p>But as of October 28th 2015, we have integrated this application in a portal, together with other reports and dashboards.</p>
            <p class="giarte-link">The link to the new portal is: <a href="https://insight.itsat.com/" target="_blank">https://insight.itsat.com/</a> </p>
            <p>If you were a user of the Action Client, you can set a new password. Go to the portal and click on the link ‘forgot password’. After submitting your email address, an email with instructions will be sent.</p>
            <div class="previous-version">
                <p class="header">Previous version action client </p>
                <p>Due to various reasons, not all our ITsat customers have already been migrated. They access the previous version of the Action Client <a href="https://action2.itsat.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>
